# Getting Started #

To make use of the code, the user will need to download `chebtran.py` from the [Scientific Python Blog](http://www.scientificpython.net/1/post/2012/05/fast-chebyshev-transforms-revisited.html) into the folder containing the trunk of the code.

Run `python main.py --help` to see what parameters are available.

Example scripts for running the code and for submitting several runs to be performed in parallel can be found in the `scripts` directory.

The code is a revised version of the Cheybshev code described in the appendix of [Leguy et al. 2014](http://www.the-cryosphere-discuss.net/8/363/2014/tcd-8-363-2014.html).
